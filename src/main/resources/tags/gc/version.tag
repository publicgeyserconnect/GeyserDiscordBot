__What version do I use?__

GeyserConnect always and only supports the **latest release version** of Bedrock within as quickly a time frame as is possible. Beta versions are not supported however, and neither are previous versions. 
If you need and outdated version because the server you want to play on is outdated, look at the pinned messaged under <#858119400808513547> for information on connecting to such servers.
