issues: This server requires secure profiles || multiplayer.disconnect.missing_public_key || Invalid signature for profile public key

Minecraft 1.19 adds key signing, which is currently only used to verify that chat messages are coming from the right player. 
GeyserConnect currently does not support this, so it will need to be disabled by the server admin.
