GeyserConnect does not support betas, and you can opt out of Bedrock betas using this guide:
<https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360040841471-How-to-Join-and-leave-a-Minecraft-Beta>

Our "beta" server is for beta versions and beta configurations of GeyserConnect itself, not for Bedrock beta.

GeyserConnect sometimes support Java Snapshots (betas) by using our VIAaaS server. Please refer to the pinned messages in <#858119400808513547>.
