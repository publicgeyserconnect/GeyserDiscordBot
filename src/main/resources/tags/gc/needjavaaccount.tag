issues: you need a java edition account to play on this server

---

Please remember that everything relating to Bedrock and Java are separate, even if using the same MS account.
This can happen for a couple of reasons:
- You don't have a paid version of java associated with the account info you entered.
- You don't have a skin assigned to your java character. Go to minecraft.net to fix this one.
