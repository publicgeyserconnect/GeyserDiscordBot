Whenever you login to your Microsoft Account (MSA), you may get an email from Microsoft about "suspicious activity." This is normal, and to be expected. This server is a proxy, and acts like any other proxy or internet VPN and hides your real IP from Microsoft. This means when you login, the security email will show you an IP address from either Austin, TX, USA, which is where the US server is hosted; or from Belgium, which is where the EU server is hosted. We do not obtain or retain any login credentials.

We have removed the ability to use the password login system. This is for both players' accounts' security, as well as the security of our servers.
