`Oudated Server` usually means that the server you are connecting to has not been updated to the latest version. To get arround this, you can use our VIAaaS server. Run the command `!!viaaas` in <#795436293999165450>

If you can't even connect to GeyserConnect because of this, check out the `!!beta` tag in <#795436293999165450>
