I can't login with my MicroSoft Account (MSA)!

- You don't have a paid Java account associated with your MSA. You must have paid for the game in order to use the MSA login, your Bedrock game does not count.

- If you are on a mobile device, you'll find yourself getting disconnected. Simply reconnect, select your server again, and you'll automatically be sent to the server.
