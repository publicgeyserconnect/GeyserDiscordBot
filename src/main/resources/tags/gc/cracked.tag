This server is a service for *Bedrock* players to join servers. Bedrock's design assumes that users have a valid license to play the game. As such, we won't fuss about players wanting to connect to "cracked" or offline mode servers.
However, we ***will not help you find any.***
If you can't (or don't know how to) find one, we will refer you to find a Geyser-enabled server. Geyser-enabled servers can be found on the Public GeyserConnect's "Geyer Servers" menu entry, in the <#754458074818805811> channel on the official [GeyserMC Discord](https://discord.gg/geysermc), and a special page is also linked via our [website](https://www.geyserconnect.net/crossplat-servers.htm).
