You will use the address of either `us.geyserconnect.net` or `eu.geyserconnect.net` with port `19132` in any of the methods listed below:

Choose a method based on what type of device you own:

***iOS:*** Download [BedrockTogether](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bedrocktogether/id1534593376), enter the GC info, then go to your game's "Friends" tab. 
[MC Server Connector](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mc-server-connector/id1548251304) is an alternative, which exists for both Android and Apple.

***Android:*** Download the [GeyserMC Android app](https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/GeyserAndroid/job/master/), select "LAN Proxy" or "Join a Bedrock Server," enter the GC info, then go to your game's "Friends" tab.
If you can't install APKs, you may use [MC Server Connector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokiem.mcserverconnector) instead, but it has ads and in-app purchases unlike the GMC app.

***PC:*** Download and setup [Phantom](https://github.com/jhead/phantom) on your computer, you may also be able to run the android app from [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/). enter the GC info to set it up and make your way to your game's "Friends" tab.
