VIAaaS is short for Via As A Service (or Server). This is a proxy server not unlike GeyserConnect, but it allows players to play with mis-matched game versions.
Here on the Public GeyserConnect, we focus on using the ViaVersion functionality, which allows the latest game versions to play on outdated servers.

A bit more detailed information is available on our [Outdated Servers page](https://www.geyserconnect.net/outdated-server).

You will need to use the [VIAaaS Login Page](https://via-login.geyserconnect.net) to use the service.

There is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7drElzKjeY&t=451s) to assist with using it.
