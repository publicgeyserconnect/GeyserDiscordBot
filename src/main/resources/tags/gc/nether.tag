Bedrock does not support building on the Nether roof. If you need to be able to build on top of the nether, use our experimental instance at `beta.geyserconnect.net`. The setting to allow bedrock to build on top of the roof, but causes the sky to appear as The End.

Keep in mind that this server is not considered "stable" and problems are to be expected.
