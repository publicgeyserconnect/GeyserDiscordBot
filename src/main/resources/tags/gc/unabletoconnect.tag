If the GeyserConnect was "just working but now it's not," you may have minimized your game, swtiched apps, or returned to the home screen. There is a stupid bug introduced by Microsft that causes the game to stop connecting to anything if you minimize the game.
Simply completely exit your game and restart it to fix this.
