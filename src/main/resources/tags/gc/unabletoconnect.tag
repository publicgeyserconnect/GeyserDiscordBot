If the GeyserConnect was "just working but now it's not," you may have minimized your game, swtiched apps, or returned to the home screen. There is a stupid bug introduced by Microsft that causes the game to stop connecting to anything if you minimize the game.
Simply completely exit your game and restart it to fix this. This is also expected behavoir for mobile users while logging in. Simply proceed again and you'll be connected to your server.
