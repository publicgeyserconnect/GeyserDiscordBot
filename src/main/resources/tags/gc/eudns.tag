We currently do not have a European DNS. However, console users can still use our EU server with minimal issue.

Once connected, simply navigate to "Geyer Servers" and select the "EU GeyserConnect Node" entry.
This will disconnect you from the US server, and reconnect you to the EU server.

P.S. This is only useful for connecting to Java only servers. If you are connecting to a bedrock or Geyser-enabled server, this is unneccessary as you are disconnected from GeyserConnect and reconnected to such servers.
