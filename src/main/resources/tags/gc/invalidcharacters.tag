If you see the message that states "Your username contains invalid characters," this would most likely be a result of your bedrock username containing a space. There are two options currently:
1. Change your Bedrock (XBox Live) username to remove the space. You may replace it with an underscore (`_`) if you wish.
2. While the password login remains active, you may set the server's connection settings to use online mode. When presented with the login screen, select "Mojang Login," enter your username of choice, then leave the password field blank.
