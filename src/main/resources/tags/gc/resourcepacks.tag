If a server requires the use of a resourcepack, we cannot retrieve it for you at this time. This is simply a limitation of the conversion system at the current time.

While GeyserConnect supports the use of custom bedrock resourcepacks, any packs would be forced to all users of the server. For this reason, we only force a functional pack and the X-Mas pack in December. To use your own , you must convert it and import it into your game.
